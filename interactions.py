PARAMETERS
model: a decision tree trained on some data set
outcome_space_x: a matrix describing the possible x values in the total outcome space
input_space_y: a matrix describing the possible y values in the total outcome space
these two should be ordered such that x outcomes match with y outcomes
assignment: an assignment vector starting at x_0
S: a vector with boolean values indicating variables whose interactions we are attempting to describe,
ordered starting at x_0"""
"""
OUTPUT
a matrix with row vectors in the form [y_i, p(y_i)] for y_i unique y values in input_space_y, and
p(y_i) a probability value associated with y_i
